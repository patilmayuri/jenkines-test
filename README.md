## REAN VPN between VPCs Blueprint

### Openswan
  Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) provides customers with tremendous network routing flexibility. This document describes how a customer can create a secure IPSec tunnel to connect multiple VPCs into a larger virtual private network that allows instances in each VPC to seamlessly connect to each other using private IP addresses.

### Example VPC Setup

### Steps to deploy

- Import environment from blueprint in DeployNow from location : https://github.com/reancloud/deploynow-blueprints
- Update input variable on DeployNow UI deploynow_ip, my_public_ip, EIP1_allocation_id, EIP2_allocation_id
   eg. Input variables
   ```json
  {
  "VPC1_CIDR": "10.0.0.0/16",
  "VPC2_CIDR": "172.16.0.0/16",
  "deploynow_ip": "54.69.86.230",
  "my_public_ip": "202.149.218.202",
  "EIP1_allocation_id": "eipalloc-5928d33f",
  "EIP2_allocation_id": "eipalloc-2628d340"
  }
  ```

- Deploy environment

2. REAN-VPN-between-VPCs-Blueprint
- Your instances from different VPC's can communicate.

- Destroy environment
